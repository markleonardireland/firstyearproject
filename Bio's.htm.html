      <p dir="ltr">In 2013, while studying in Trinity College, Dublin, Ken Jin Son met fellow exchange student Drake Orrises. Both were in the same Engineering course as Noel Darkarm, the trio soon discovered their similarities in music tastes and decided to form a band. Noel asked childhood friend and bass player Josh Calamines to join the band to complete the quartet. The band began touring locally in the Skerries and Rush regions of North County Dublin, establishing a committed fan base. </p>

      <p dir="ltr">Noel &quot;NoArm&quot; Darkarm - is an Irish singer. Born in the seaside town of Skerries (one of the top ten cities in the world) Noel Darkarm discovered his love for music one summer downing pints outside Joe mays on skerries harbour and singing songs until the early hours of those glorious summer days. In an attempt to be the quickest man to ascend mount Everest, Darkarm lost his arm to frostbit, speaking of said incident he was quoted saying &quot;you wouldn't long getting frostbit nigh&quot;. He carries on his love for music still today by singing for the greatest band in the world, Smuggler's cave.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Ken &ldquo;Sparkles&rdquo; Jin Son - is a South Korean guitarist. Born and raised in Seoul. Ken's parents bought him his first guitar when he was just 3 years old, by the age of 4 he had mastered 'Sweet Child O' Mine' by Guns 'n' Roses and 'Stairway to Heaven' by Led Zeppelin, declaring in a recent interview with NME that they were &quot;pi** easy to learn&quot;. By the age of 10 he was teaching Music at the University of Seoul to people more than twice his age. Ken grew frustrated with the lack of skills his students had, so made a change of career and decided to study abroad. Ken moved to Ireland in 2013 when he was 21 as part student exchange program where he met current band mates, Noel, Drake and Josh. </p>

    Drake &quot;Dr.O&quot; Orrises - is an American Drummer. Drake also known as &quot;Dr.O&quot; was born in New York City, USA. Not much is known of his childhood, declaring in a recent interview with 'Time' magazine that he had been &quot;homeless since I was a kid until I was 16, and my mom was a crack head. My life changed when I found a wallet on the street belonging to a guy named Bill Gates, and there was 4000 bucks in it that I kept for myself&quot;. With the money Dr.O got himself to Ireland to get an education. Vowing to not return to NYC until he has enough money to pay Mr. Gates back. The background of his nickname has caused much speculation from fans of the band, rumour has it he was 'handy with a scalpel on the streets of NYC'. In 2015 Drake was accused of pushing Madonna down a stairs at the BRIT awards ceremony.</strong></td>
